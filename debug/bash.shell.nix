# Debugging shell: drops you into a bash session inside the sandbox.
# Mirror the rwDirs, rwFiles, and allowedPackages from your agent config
# to reproduce the exact environment your agent will see.
#
# Usage:
#   nix-shell debug/bash.shell.nix
#
# Once inside, try:
#   ls $HOME                   # empty ephemeral tmpfs with symlinks to rwDirs/rwFiles
#   cat $HOME/.claude.json     # should work if in rwFiles
#   ls /tmp                    # should be writable scratch space
#   curl https://httpbin.org/get       # allowed domain (GET only) — should work
#   curl -X POST https://httpbin.org/post  # blocked method — should fail
#   curl https://example.com          # blocked domain — should fail
#   which git                  # check allowedPackages are visible
#   ls /some/other/path        # should fail — confirming the sandbox is active
#   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519      # should fail — confirming the sandbox is active and your real home isn't visible
